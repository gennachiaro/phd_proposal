## Approach

Sampling horizons for this project were chosen to (1) span the full duration of ignimbrite emplacement, (2) represent key lithologies based on observed textural variations and bulk rock geochemistry, and (3) reflect features within the section that might relate to possible time gaps (Fig. 5).  These locations were identified from stratigraphic logs in Willcock et al. (2013) which characterize observed changes in volcanic lithofacies.  I also utilized work detailing the stratigraphic variation of bulk rock compositions and crystal contents from Willcock et al. (2015) to inform my sampling strategy.

*Mineral-Based Fiamme Classification:*

I plan to build on the work completed for my M.S. (Chiaro, 2019) and determine a mineral-based characterization scheme in order to categorize fiamme throughout the entire Ora deposit.  Since fiamme with unaltered glass are only present at the vitrophyre horizons, we will use mineral compositions to fingerprint each fiamma.  This involves collecting major and trace elements of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, and biotite for each fiamme type and population.  Preliminary work shows that biotite and plagioclase major elements can be used to differentiate intracaldera vs. outflow fiamme (Fig. 6).  Furthermore, biotite major element compositions can be used to infer both fiamme type and population (Fig. 6).  

Sliwinski et al. (2017) has shown that biotite trace element compositions can be used to fingerprint magma batches at Las Cañadas volcano in Tenerife.  Our glass trace element compositions differentiate fiamme populations in Ora; each fiamme population is interpreted to represent an individual magma batch (Fig. 3, 6).  Biotite grown from these discrete magma batches will likely retain different rim trace element compositions, allowing for mineral-based classification for different magma batches.

*Hierarchical Clustering and Machine Learning in Python:*

The foundation for this project requires major and trace element compositions for entire minerals.  The major element compositions for feldspars and biotite will be collected from EDS maps.  Afterwards, we will obtain trace element profiles for each of the grains.  

I will develop a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm in python for major elements in order to statistically determine how many clusters of minerals are present in the sampled fiamme.  Another clustering algorithm will be completed using trace elements and we will compare the results.  Once the clusters are identified, we can observe whether they correlate with fiamme type and population (Chiaro, 2019).  If we see a correlation, we can confidently use mineral compositions to classify fiamme throughout the Ora Ignimbrite.  

We can also use the mineral maps to visualize core to rim cluster evolution (Fig. 7).  By noting where the clusters occur in each mineral and by looking at a large enough population of core to rim clusters, we can infer whether crystals experienced similar histories.  This approach may reveal information regarding the magmatic processes that occurred prior to the Ora eruption (injection, decompression-driven growth, etc).

The colors and numbers at the bottom indicate the corresponding cluster identified with major elements.  (E) The same as D, but for another crystal that is not shown (from Luca Caricchi).</p>

We are also interested in identifying the mineral populations present in the ignimbrite matrix and observing whether this varies throughout the deposit.  Machine learning algorithms are becoming widely incorporated in scientific studies and they provide an opportunity to make tedious point-counting obsolete.  I plan to develop a machine learning algorithm in python that can classify each mineral in a phase composition map into its associated population.
  
This involves creating phase composition maps (PCMs) from full thin section BSE images.  Utilizing BSE scans instead of EDS scans is much faster and we can show mineral phases and compositions rather than elemental concentrations (Willis et al., 2017).  This process involves calibrating BSE greyscale values with EDS mineral analyses.  
  
We then have to train the code to classify each mineral with its correct population (based on major element clustering).  The image recognition will be completed with the scikitlearn package in python.  Initial formulation will involve training a supervised machine learning algorithm to identify feldspars.  If successful, we will work to develop an unsupervised neural network algorithm.  The unsupervised neural network algorithm will effectively create clusters automatically via self-organizing maps and then it will tag each mineral with its identified population. 

*Spatial Statistics in ArcGIS:*

The spatial distribution of fiamme types and populations has the potential to reveal the locations of eruptive vents that were destroyed during the eruption.  Multi-distance spatial cluster analysis (Ripley’s k-function) in Arc-GIS investigates the clustering of features over a defined study area.  Similarly, this may provide insight on the pre-eruptive magmatic architecture.  For example, if the Ora system had two laterally juxtaposed magma chambers that were tapped by different eruptive conduits, we would expect to find two separate clusters with discrete fiamme populations.  Integrating spatial statistics and petrology can help us determine how magma was stored in the crust prior to eruption (single chamber, multiple chambers?) and the approximate locations of storage in the x-y plane.  If we combine our previously obtained Rhyolite-MELTS data to this model, we can elucidate pre-eruptive storage conditions in three-dimensions.

*Sequence Stratigraphy and Ar-Ar Age Dating:*

We propose to investigate whether fiamme type and population change as a supereruption progresses.  Our approach will take advantage of the previous work done by Willcock et al. (2013) in which they correlated stratigraphic logs throughout the deposit with observed changes in volcanic lithofacies for 13 intracaldera and 7 outflow stratigraphic sections.  More detailed efforts to ascertain the temporal changes of the Ora eruption involved plotting the bulk rock compositions, biotite crystal content, and total crystal content as they varied stratigraphically (Willcock et al., 2015) (Fig. 6).  We have identified potential horizons of interest that may signify a change in eruptive material (Fig. 6).  By sampling the fiamme types present at these locations, we hope to discover whether there are gradual or instantaneous changes in the fiamme types and populations.  Similar to the methodology employed in sedimentary strata with fossil assemblages, we may be able to observe fiamme “extinction horizons” representing the depletion of a magma chamber.  We will also utilize this workflow on samples of the ignimbrite matrix with a machine learning algorithm to determine whether we see a change in mineral populations with time.  These methods will allow us to extract relative timescales for magmatic events taking place during the Ora supereruption.

<p align="center">Figure 6: Bulk rock compositions, biotite crystal content (Bt), and total crystal content (CF) variation through time.  The yellow stars indicate horizons of interest that could show potential changes in eruptive material.  Locations 3 and 8 are intracaldera deposits and correlate with Ora 3 and Ora 8.  We have yet to sample from location 20, which is just south of the Ora 2 vitrophyre unit.  Figure is modified from Willcock et al., 2015.</p>

There has not been much work done regarding age dating for the Ora Ignimbrite.  Marocchi et al. (2008) obtained single zircon ages for Ora Ignimbrite of 277 +/- 2 Ma for the intracaldera fill and 274.1 +/- 1.6 Ma for the outflow.  These suggest a time break in the eruptive record.  Willcock et al. (2015) suggests that Ora experienced a two-stage eruptive history: the southern caldera collapsed first and the northern caldera followed.  However, there is no evidence for paleosols or reworked contacts, suggesting that the eruptions were closely spaced in time.  The zircon ages are in contrast with the inferred eruption timescale based on stratigraphic evidence.  In order to determine whether the Ora eruption lasted for millions of years or was constrained to a shorter time period, we plan to obtain Ar-Ar sanidine ages.  Argon is trapped upon eruption so these will provide eruptive ages.  We will first determine eruption ages for the intracaldera vitrophyre and the outflow vitrophyre to see if we can resolve discrete ages.  If so, Ar-Ar sanidine ages provide a methodology to “deconstruct” a supereruption into distinct volcanic pulses (Kay, 2011).  Combined with our work on fiamme type distribution for a stratigraphic column, we may be able to resolve maximum timescales of magma chamber depletion for the Ora system.
