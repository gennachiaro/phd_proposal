## Approach

Building on the work from Chiaro et al. (in prep), we propose to use mineral compositions in order to apply this characterization scheme to the entire Ora deposit.  Since unaltered glass is only present in the vitrophyre horizons, we plan to use mineral compositions to classify each fiamma.  We will collect trace and major elements of plagioclase, alkali feldspar and biotite in fiamme.  Preliminary work shows that biotite and plagioclase major elements can be used to differentiate intracaldera vs. outflow fiamme.  Furthermore, biotite major element compositions can be used to infer both fiamme type and population (Fig. 4).

*Hierarchical Clustering and Machine Learning in Python:*

The foundation for this project involves obtaining mineral compositions for the entire crystal.  After creating biotite and feldspar EDS maps and collecting trace element profiles, I plan to utilize a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm for major elements in order to statistically determine how many clusters of minerals are present in the fiamme.  Another clustering algorithm will be run using trace elements and we will compare the results.  Once the clusters are identified, we can observe whether they correlate with fiamme type and population (Chiaro et al., in prep).  If we see a correlation, we can confidently use mineral populations to classify fiamme throughout the Ora Ignimbrite.  We can also use the mineral maps to visualize core to rim cluster evolution (Fig. 5).  By visualizing where the clusters occur in each mineral and by looking at a large enough population of core to rim clusters, we can infer whether crystals experienced similar histories.  This approach may reveal information regarding the magmatic processes which occurred prior to the Ora eruption (injection, decompression-driven growth, etc).

The circles show the location of the electron microprobe analysis and the color indicates the corresponding cluster from major element analysis.  (D) Trace element profiles from A-B.  The colors and numbers at the bottom indicate the corresponding cluster identified with major elements.  (E) The same as D, but for another crystal that is not shown (from Luca Caricchi).

We are also interested in identifying the mineral populations that are present in the ignimbrite matrix and seeing whether this varies throughout the deposit.  Machine learning algorithms are becoming widely incorporated in scientific studies, and they provide an opportunity to make tedious point-counting obsolete.  By utilizing previously determined mineral clusters (major element-based clustering), we can train a machine to classify each mineral in a thin section EDS scan into its associated population.  Furthermore, this automatic clustering can be applied to multiple large thin sections, allowing for an estimation of bulk eruptive material.  Initial formulation will involve training a supervised machine learning algorithm to identify feldspars.  If successful, we will work to develop an unsupervised neural network algorithm.  The unsupervised neural network algorithm will effectively create clusters automatically via self-organizing maps and then it will tag each mineral with its identified population.

*Spatial Statistics in ArcGIS:*

The spatial distribution of fiamme types and populations has the potential to reveal the locations of eruptive vents that were destroyed during the eruption.  Multi-distance spatial cluster analysis (Ripley’s k-function) in Arc-GIS investigates the clustering of features over a defined study area.  Similarly, this may provide insight on the pre-eruptive magmatic architecture.  For example, if the Ora system had two laterally juxtaposed magma chambers that were tapped by different eruptive conduits, we would expect to find two separate clusters with discrete fiamme populations.  Integrating spatial statistics and petrology can help us determine how magma was stored in the crust prior to eruption (single chamber, multiple chambers?) and the approximate locations of storage in the x-y plane.  If we combine our previously obtained Rhyolite-MELTS data to this model, we can elucidate pre-eruptive storage conditions in three-dimensions.

*Sequence Stratigraphy and Ar-Ar Age Dating:*

We propose to investigate whether fiamme type and population change as a supereruption progresses.  Our approach will take advantage of the previous work done by Willcock et al. (2013) in which they correlated stratigraphic logs throughout the deposit with observed changes in volcanic lithofacies for 13 intracaldera and 7 outflow stratigraphic sections.  More detailed efforts to ascertain the temporal changes of the Ora eruption involved plotting the bulk rock compositions, biotite crystal content, and total crystal content as they varied stratigraphically (Willcock et al., 2015) (Fig. 6).  We have identified potential horizons of interest that may signify a change in eruptive material (Fig. 6).  By sampling the fiamme types present at these locations, we hope to discover whether there are gradual or instantaneous changes in the fiamme types or populations.  Similar to the methodology employed in sedimentary strata with fossil assemblages, we may be able to observe fiamme “extinction horizons” representing the depletion of a magma chamber.  We will also utilize this workflow on samples of the ignimbrite matrix with a machine learning algorithm to determine whether we see a change in mineral populations with time.  These methods will allow us to extract relative timescales for magmatic events taking place during the Ora supereruption.

<p align="center">Figure 6: Bulk rock compositions, biotite crystal content (Bt), and total crystal content (CF) variation through time.  The yellow stars indicate horizons of interest that could show potential changes in eruptive material.  Locations 3 and 8 are intracaldera deposits and correlate with Ora 3 and Ora 8.  We have yet to sample from location 20, which is just south of the Ora 2 vitrophyre unit.  Figure is modified from Willcock et al., 2015.

There has not been much work done regarding age dating for the Ora Ignimbrite.  Marocchi et al. (2008) obtained single zircon ages for Ora Ignimbrite of 277 +/- 2 Ma for the intracaldera fill and 274.1 +/- 1.6 Ma for the outflow.  These suggest a time break in the eruptive record.  Willcock et al. (2015) suggests that Ora experienced a two-stage eruptive history: the southern caldera collapsed first and the northern caldera followed.  However, there is no evidence for paleosols or reworked contacts, suggesting that the eruptions were closely spaced in time.  The zircon ages are in contrast with the inferred eruption timescale based on stratigraphic evidence.  In order to determine whether the Ora eruption lasted for millions of years or was constrained to a shorter time period, we plan to obtain Ar-Ar sanidine ages.  Argon is trapped upon eruption so these will provide eruptive ages.  We will first determine eruption ages for the intracaldera vitrophyre and the outflow vitrophyre to see if we can resolve discrete ages.  If so, Ar-Ar sanidine ages provide a methodology to “deconstruct” a supereruption into distinct volcanic pulses (Kay, 2011).  Combined with our work on fiamme type distribution for a stratigraphic column, we may be able to resolve maximum timescales of magma chamber depletion for the Ora system.
