## Approach

Sampling horizons for this project were chosen to (1) span the full duration of ignimbrite emplacement, (2) represent key lithologies based on observed textural variations and bulk rock geochemistry, and (3) reflect features within the section that might relate to possible time gaps (Fig. 5).  These locations were identified from stratigraphic logs in Willcock et al. (2013) which characterize observed changes in volcanic lithofacies.  I also utilized work detailing the stratigraphic variation of bulk rock compositions and crystal contents from Willcock et al. (2015) to inform my sampling strategy.

*Mineral-Based Fiamme Classification:*

I plan to build on the work completed for my M.S. (Chiaro, 2019) and determine a mineral-based characterization scheme in order to categorize fiamme throughout the entire Ora deposit.  Fiamme with well-preserved glass are only present in the vitrophyre horizons; this necessitates an alternative approach to fingerprinting fiamme.  We will use mineral major and trace element compositions from plagioclase, alkali feldspar, and biotite to determine each fiamme type and population.  Preliminary work shows that biotite and plagioclase major elements can be used to differentiate intracaldera vs. outflow fiamme (Fig. 6).  Furthermore, biotite major element compositions can be used to infer both fiamme type and population (Fig. 6).  

Sliwinski et al. (2017) has shown that biotite trace element compositions can be used to fingerprint magma batches at Las Cañadas volcano in Tenerife.  Similarly, biotite major elements have been used to differentiate tephra deposits of the Toba Tuff (Smith et al., 2011).  Our glass trace element compositions differentiate fiamme populations in Ora; each fiamme population is interpreted to represent an individual magma batch (Fig. 3, 6).  Biotite rims grown from these discrete magma batches will likely retain different trace element compositions, allowing for a mineral-based classification to fingerprint different magma batches.

*Hierarchical Clustering and Machine Learning in Python:*

The foundation of this project requires major and trace element compositions for entire minerals.  I plan to develop a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm in python for major elements in order to statistically determine how many clusters of minerals are present in the sampled fiamme.  Another clustering algorithm will be completed using trace elements and we will compare the results.  Once the clusters are identified, we can observe whether they correlate with fiamme type and population (Chiaro, 2019).  If we see a correlation, we can confidently use mineral compositions to classify fiamme throughout the Ora Ignimbrite.  

I will also create individual mineral maps in order to visualize core to rim cluster evolution (Fig. 7).  These maps will be created in two ways: (1) from EDS scans and (2) by correlating BSE greyscale values with EDS analyses.  We will determine which method is best by comparing efficiency and accuracy.  By noting where the clusters occur in each mineral and by looking at a large enough population of core to rim clusters, we can infer whether crystals experienced similar histories.  This approach may reveal information regarding the magmatic processes that occurred prior to the Ora eruption (injection, decompression-driven growth, etc.).

The colors and numbers at the bottom indicate the corresponding cluster identified with major elements.  (E) The same as D, but for another crystal that is not shown (from Luca Caricchi).</p>

We are also interested in identifying the mineral populations present in the ignimbrite matrix and observing whether this varies throughout the deposit.  Machine learning algorithms are becoming widely incorporated in scientific studies and they provide an opportunity to make tedious point-counting obsolete.  I plan to develop a machine learning algorithm in python that can classify each mineral in a phase composition map into its associated population.
  
This involves creating phase composition maps (PCMs) from full thin section BSE images.  Utilizing BSE scans instead of EDS scans is much faster and we can show mineral phases and compositions rather than elemental concentrations (Willis et al., 2017).  This process involves calibrating BSE greyscale values with EDS mineral analyses.  
  
We then have to train the code to classify each mineral with its correct population (based on major element clustering).  The image recognition will be completed with the scikitlearn package in python.  Initial formulation will involve training a supervised machine learning algorithm to identify feldspars.  If successful, we will work to develop an unsupervised neural network algorithm.  The unsupervised neural network algorithm will effectively create clusters automatically via self-organizing maps and then it will tag each mineral with its identified population. 

*Hot Spot Cluster Analysis in ArcGIS:*

We plan to utilize a hot-spot clustering analysis (Ripley’s k-function) in ArcGIS in order to see whether fiamme populations are constrained to specific regions.  This multi-distance spatial cluster analyses investigates the clustering of features over a defined study area.  We believe that this may provide insight on the pre-eruptive magmatic architecture. For example, if the Ora system had two laterally juxtaposed magma chambers that were tapped by different eruptive conduits, we would expect to find two separate clusters with discrete fiamme populations.  Integrating spatial statistics and petrology can help us determine how magma was stored in the crust prior to eruption (single chamber, multiple chambers?) and the approximate locations of storage in the x-y plane.  If we combine our previously obtained Rhyolite-MELTS data to this model, we can elucidate pre-eruptive storage conditions in three-dimensions.

*Sequence Stratigraphy and Ar-Ar Age Dating:*

This aspect of my project will provide a critical temporal framework for the Ora deposits and a context for understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of a giant magmatic system.  Single crystal 40Ar/39Ar sanidine geochronology has the potential to distinguish episodes within supereruption-scale sequences; e.g. Kay et al. (2011) identified three volcanic pulses within the 2 Ma Cerro Galan Ignimbrite.  Ages of the Permian Ora deposits cannot achieve the same absolute precision, but if they span >~50 kyr we should be able to evaluate the eruptive tempo. 

The eruption duration will be determined by obtaining 40Ar/39Ar sanidine ages for early, middle, and late deposits in both the southern and northern calderas (Fig. 5).  Comparison of early-erupted sanidine ages from both calderas can reveal whether there was a break in time for the two-stage caldera collapse model suggested by Willcock et al. (2015). To determine whether the Ora supereruption can be subdivided into distinct volcanic pulses, we will sample from strata with observable changes in lithofacies and bulk rock geochemistry (Willcock et al., 2013). These variations may represent the tapping of distinct magma bodies.

We are also interested in seeing whether we can identify different phases of the eruption and the activation of new volcanic vents.  Can we observe the transition from the early-erupted material (VCCR + FG) to the late-erupted material (MG + FGCP) in the stratigraphic record?  Is it an instantaneous switch?  Or do we find a horizon which includes all four fiamme types?  The possibility that some supereruptions occurred episodically, rather than ~instantaneously, is significant for understanding the storage and mobilization of eruptible magma in the shallow crust (e.g. Cashman et al., 2017).  Evidence for multiple distinct eruptions can alter how we view the evolution and behavior of supereruption-sized magma systems through time.

A creative approach to these questions may provide insight on the eruption dynamics of the Ora Ignimbrite.  Similar to extinction horizons in biostratigraphy, we may be able to observe the extinction of fiamme populations in the volcanic strata.  Coupling 40Ar/39Ar ages with observed fiamme extinction trends may demonstrate whether the eruption migrated northward through time as suggested by Willcock et al (2013). If we observe a northward trend, this may suggest the sequential tapping of laterally juxtaposed magma bodies (Begué et al., 2014). If not, this may represent the eruption of multiple magma bodies emplaced at different depths within a transcrustal magmatic system (Cashman et al., 2017).
