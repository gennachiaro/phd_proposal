## Methods

*Sample Collection:*

The samples collected during the 2017 and 2019 field seasons are shown in figure 1 and their descriptions are listed in table 1.  Currently, we have a disproportionate amount of samples from the northern intracaldera.  In order to reduce the sampling bias for our spatial statistics, we will obtain more samples from the southern intracaldera and southern outflow.  Clustering analyses in ArcGIS requires at least 30 features to be reliable.  In order to sample a significant number of fiamme, we will make fiamme mounts to maximize sampling potential and analysis speed.  The ignimbrite matrix samples will be made into 75 x 50 mm billets.

*Analytical Work:*

We plan to obtain BSE full thin section scans and EDS major element compositions with the Tescan VEGA3 SEM at Vanderbilt University.  We will also collect trace element profiles using line scans with consistently spaced laser pits from the ThermoFisher iCAP Qc quadrupole ICPMS at Vanderbilt University.     

*Hierarchical Clustering and Machine Learning in Python:*

The skills to develop code for this project will be gained from taking Data Camp online courses and by utilizing the abundant wealth of information on the internet.  The hierarchical clustering algorithm will effectively calculate the Euclidean distance between all the points and store them in a proximity matrix.  Points with the smallest distances separating them will be merged into clusters until only one single cluster is left.  A dendrogram is then created and the optimum number of clusters is determined visually by intersecting the tallest vertical line in the dendrogram.

We will create phase composition maps (PCMs) for the machine learning algorithms by using the methods described in Willis et al. (2017).  This involves correlating BSE greyscale values with EDS mineral analyses.  The machine learning algorithm will be trained to classify minerals into pre-defined clusters based on pattern recognition.  

*Spatial Statistics in ArcGIS:*

Proficiency in ArcGIS was gained from an Advanced Spatial Analysis course taken in 2018 at Vanderbilt University.  ArcGIS skills will be refined by participating in an ESRI MOOC titled Spatial Data Science: The New Frontier in Analytics which runs from February 12-April 9, 2020.  The Spatial Analysis Research Laboratory (SARL) at Vanderbilt University will also provide expertise in GIS if any roadblocks may arise.   

*Ar-Ar Dating:*

Geochronological analyses will be completed at the New Mexico Geochronology Research Laboratory (NMGRL).  Sanidines will be separated, irradiated, and prepared for analysis using a Thermo Scientific Helix Multicollector.  The analytical capabilities at NMGRL predict that individual analyses will have an age precision of ~20 ka for crystal fragments weighing 0.2 mg. With the large, unaltered sanidines present at Ora, this precision can readily test my research questions.
