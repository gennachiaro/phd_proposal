## Background

The supereruption-scale Ora Ignimbrites are products of an ignimbrite flareup resulting from subduction of the Paleotethys Ocean and the consequent formation of Pangaea (Cassinis et al., 2012).  Glacial incision of the Permian Ora Ignimbrites (>1,200 km3) reveals heterogeneous intracaldera deposits with >1,000 m of relief.  Less voluminous outflow was emplaced to the north and south of the caldera and is stratigraphically similar to late-erupted intracaldera units (Marocchi et al., 2008).  The Ora deposits are interpreted to be low-intensity eruptions that tapped multiple magma bodies and were sourced from discrete vents (Willcock et al., 2015).  Bulk rock chemistry and mineralogy suggest that caldera collapse and eruption initiated in the south and migrated northward through time (Willcock et al., 2013).

Recent work investigated the pre-eruptive architecture of the Ora magmatic system by studying the textural, mineralogical, and geochemical features of fiamme (Chiaro, 2019).  Fiamme were collected from two vitrophyre horizons, an early-erupted intracaldera deposit and a late-erupted outflow deposit, in order to find well-preserved glass.  These fiamme were initially grouped into four types based on crystal content and biotite content (Table 2).  Glass major elements further verified the categorization scheme (Fig. 2).  The tight clustering of MG and VCCR glass major element compositions suggests that the glasses are unaltered and thus represent pristine melt compositions (Fig. 2).

<p align="center">Figure 2: All fiamme major element glass compositions.  The colors correspond to the fiamme types shown above in Table 2. (a) The tight clustering of VCCR and MG fiamme suggest that these glasses did not undergo alteration.  (b) Clustering in the Na2O vs. K2O plot provides further evidence that the VCCR and MG glasses represent pristine melt compositions.</p>

Glass trace element compositions reveal at least three discrete populations for both the VCCR and MG fiamme, suggesting the presence of multiple magma batches within the Ora system (Fig. 3).  Furthermore, the magma batches that erupted to form the intracaldera deposits were distinct from the magma batches that contributed to the outflow.  

Pre-eruptive storage pressures from the Rhyolite-MELTS (Q2F) geobarometer suggest that there were two potential scenarios for the subsurface organization of magma bodies in the Ora system (Fig. 4).  Either there were two distinct crystal mush zones located at slightly different depths within the crust, or there was a continuous crystal mush present with multiple heterogeneous zones located throughout (Chiaro, 2019).

(b) Silica content vs. pressure shows variable storage depths for the FGCP melt, suggesting that there were multiple, small melt bodies located at different depths throughout the magma chamber (from Chiaro, 2019).</p>
